	<h1>Carbohydrates</h1>
	<p>You may have heard of low-carb diets as being a good thing, and while there is some merit to that as most diets have an excess of carbohydrate and a deficiency in protein, fibre and fat, the ideal is a balance of each. It is important, however, to ensure that the carbohydrates in your diet are complex carbohydrates that provide energy gradually over time rather than simple carbs such as sugar that release all of the energy up front.</p>
	<h2>Complex Carbs (Eat these)</h2>

			<p><b>Sugars: </b><br> Sugar is one of the worst things to eat, as many are already aware. However, be careful as sugar is in a lot of things you might not expect, for example fruit juices and other processed foods.</p>
