	<h1>Fats</h1>
	<p>You may be surprised to learn that fat is an important part of your diet. It's true that some fats are very bad for you, however some are also good for you. The difference is whether the fat is saturated (bad) or unsaturated (good)</p>
	<h2>Bad Fats (Avoid these)</h2>
	<p>These are fats that are high in saturated fats and should be avoided where possible. In addition to these two plant-based examples, pretty much all animal products (buttter, meat etc) are high in saturated fats so congratulations you are already avoiding them.</p>
